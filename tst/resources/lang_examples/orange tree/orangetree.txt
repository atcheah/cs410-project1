// Shape definition
Let orange1 be an object with shape = circle, size = 30, colour = orange, rotation = 30 degrees
Let orange2 be an orange1
Let tree be an object with shape = rectangle, colour = #964b00, size = (10,40)

Let canvas be an object with shape = rectangle, colour = (255,255,255), size = (100,100)

// Composition
Let tree owns orange1 at (10,30)

// Placement
Let frame1 be an image on canvas placing orange2 at (50,30) and placing tree at (50,0)
Let frame2 be an    image    on   canvas    placing    orange2    at    (50, 0) and placing tree at (50,0)

// Animation
IF Assert that orange2 has size = 30
     THEN    ANIMATE frame1 -> frame2 FOR 5 seconds
     ELSE    DRAW frame2
